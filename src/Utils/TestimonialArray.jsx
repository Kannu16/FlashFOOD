       love using this app and keeping perfectly good food from going into
       the landfill. All of the food posted on the app is reaching its best
       before date but still perfectly good to eat. And it was only $5.00! ðŸ˜Š`,

    userComment: `I despise wasting food, and I love getting a great deal. flashfood makes it so simple for me to actually save food destined for the dump, and all they ask is that I pay a fraction of the price for it. In my personal opinion, the food is fine! No issues whatsoever! In what world does this service not make perfect sense?        `,

    userComment: `Wow! I am absolutely delighted with my first box! A great selection of produce (carrots, English cucumber, peppers, mushrooms, onions, apples, oranges and the protein (kielbasa, chicken meatballs, teriyaki chicken meatballs, pulled chicken) was awesome as well! Will most certainly order again!

    userComment: `Love it. between the wife and I who have the app on both our phones, we saved over $1200. instead of stores throwing out expired food to the dump, they can get rid of food when it's close to expiration dates. love it. I highly recommend it.
